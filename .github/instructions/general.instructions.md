Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

## General Guidelines

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write unit tests for all new functions and features. Use `pytest` for Python and appropriate testing frameworks for Node.js.
2. **Environment Variables**: Use [Environment Variables Guide](../../docs/env-vars.md) for configuration. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
3. **Documentation**: Prefer self-explanatory code; add documentation only if explicitly requested by the developer. Be concise.
4. **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback.
