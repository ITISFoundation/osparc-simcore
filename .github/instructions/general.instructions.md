## General Guidelines

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write unit tests for all new functions and features. Use `pytest` for Python and appropriate testing frameworks for Node.js.
2. **Environment Variables**: Use [Environment Variables Guide](../../docs/env-vars.md) for configuration. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
3. **Documentation**: Prefer self-explanatory code and add it **only when neeeded** in order to clarify non-obvious rationale or exceptions/errors.
4. **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback.
