# Motivation:

<!-- Staging is an intermediate environment between development (master) and production that allows us to test in isolation changes in the framework.
In addition, the pre-release workflow shall be used as a simulation to production that can help us to anticipate changes and mitigate failures.

- Explain what motivates this pre-release?
- Which important changes we might pay attention to?
- How should we test them?
- Is there anything in particular we should monitor?
-->



#  Devops check (‚ö†Ô∏è devops)
<!-- The goal here is to analyze the PRs marked with (‚ö†Ô∏è devops).  We should determine and prepare necessary changes required in the environments configs.

This procedure should be taken also as an exercise in preparation for the release to production as well.
 -->


# e2e testing check
<!-- Check that e2e in master: are there any major known issues?

Keep an agenda of what has been reported on every daily
-->
- Mon. ...
- Tue.
- Wed.
- Thu.
- Fri.


# [Commits (in order)](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/commits/master)
<!-- Is there anything in particular we should monitor?

- Mark commits with üö® to warn about possible issues. Contact PR creator to understand how to test/target
- Mark all the commits that were already cherry picked from master a hotfix as [ üìå  ``staging_switzer_5``]
