        Staging is an intermediate environment between development (master) and production that allows us to test in isolation changes in the framework.
        In addition, the pre-release workflow shall be used as a simulation to production that can help us to anticipate changes and mitigate failures.

        - Which important changes we might pay attention to?
        - How should we test them?
        - Is there anything in particular we should monitor?
