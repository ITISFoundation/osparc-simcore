Create a concise and precise summary in Markdown format which can be used in a pull request of the current git branch against the `master` branch. For this you will need to investigate the git diff against `master`. Focus on user-facing functionality changes and on code architecture changes. Make your summary precise and very concise. The summary should be a maximum of 20 lines. Present your summary as Markdown in a text box so I see a button for copying the text directly to the clipboard.
