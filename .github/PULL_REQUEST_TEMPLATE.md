- How can DevOps safely and gracefully restart the service ?
- How and why would this code fail ?
- What kind of metrics are you exposing ?
- Is there any documentation/design specification for the service ?
- How (e.g. through which loglines) can DevOps detect unexpected situations that require escalation to human ?
