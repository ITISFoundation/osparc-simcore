<!-- Some checks that might help your code run stable on production, and help devops assess criticality.
Modified from https://oschvr.com/posts/what-id-like-as-sre/

- How can DevOps check the health of the service ?
- How can DevOps safely and gracefully restart the service ?
- How and why would this code fail ?
- What kind of metrics are you exposing ?
- Is there any documentation/design specification for the service ?
- How (e.g. through which loglines) can DevOps detect unexpected situations that require escalation to human ?
- What are the resource limitations (CPU, RAM) expected for this service ?
- Are all relevant variables documented and adjustable via environment variables (i.e. no hardcoded magic numbers) ?
