## DeferredHandler lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    * --> Scheduled: via [start_deferred]
    ** --> ManuallyCancelled: via [cancel_deferred]

    ManuallyCancelled --> Worker: attempts to cancel task in

    Scheduled --> SubmitTask: calls [on_deferred_created]
    SubmitTask --> Worker

    ErrorResult --> SubmitTask: try again
    Worker --> ErrorResult: upon error
    ErrorResult --> FinishedWithError: gives up when out of retries or if cancelled
    Worker --> DeferredResult: success

    DeferredResult --> °: calls [on_deferred_result]
    FinishedWithError --> °°: calls [on_finished_with_error]
    Worker --> °°°: task cancelled
```

### States
- `Scheduled`: triggered by `start_deferred` and creates a TASK
- `SubmitTask`: decreases retry counter
- `Worker`: checks if slots are available (can refuse task), invokes `run_deferred` code and saves the result. Only state in which local state is used (to run the task).
- `ErrorResult`: checks if it can retry the gives up
- `FinishedWIthError`: logs error, invokes `on_finished_with_error` and removes the TASK
- `DeferredResult`: invokes `on_deferred_result` and removes the TASK
- `ManuallyCancelled`: cancels the task and removes the TASK


### Workflows

A typical sequence would look like:
- user calls `start_deferred`
- `Scheduled` state is processed -> calls `on_deferred_created`
- `SubmitTask` state is processed
- `Worker` state is processed
- `DeferredResult` state is processed -> calls `on_deferred_result`
