The `nocopy` flag only applies to named volumes.\n- `[ro|rw]` mounts a volume read-only or read-write, respectively.\n  If omitted or set to `rw`, volumes are mounted read-write.\n- `[z|Z]` applies SELinux labels to allow or deny multiple containers\n  to read and write to the same volume.\n    - `z`: a _shared_ content label is applied to the content. This\n      label indicates that multiple containers can share the volume\n      content, for both reading and writing.\n    - `Z`: a _private unshared_ label is applied to the content.\n      This label indicates that only the current container can use\n      a private volume. Labeling systems such as SELinux require\n      proper labels to be placed on volume content that is mounted\n      into a container. Without a label, the security system can\n      prevent a container's processes from using the content. By\n      default, the labels set by the host operating system are not\n      modified.\n- `[[r]shared|[r]slave|[r]private]` specifies mount\n  [propagation behavior](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt).\n  This only applies to bind-mounted volumes, not internal volumes\n  or named volumes. Mount propagation requires the source mount\n  point (the location where the source directory is mounted in the\n  host operating system) to have the correct propagation properties.\n  For shared volumes, the source mount point must be set to `shared`.\n  For slave volumes, the mount must be set to either `shared` or\n  `slave`.\n",
