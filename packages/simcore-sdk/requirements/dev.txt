# Shortcut to install all packages needed to develop 'simcore-sdk'
#
# - As ci.txt but with current and repo packages in develop (edit) mode
#
# Usage:
#   pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
#

# installs base + tests requirements
-r _test.txt

# installs this repo's packages
-e ../postgres-database/[migration]
-e ../s3wrapper/
-e ../service-library/
-e ../pytest-simcore/
-e ../models-library/
../../services/storage/client-sdk/python/ # Needed ONLY for testing

# installs current package
-e .

## NOTE: Copied from ../../../requirements.txt to avoid mounting
#        basedir in docker during devel-mode.
#  TODO: Better solution needed!
