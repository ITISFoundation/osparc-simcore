# osparc-simcore -> ancillary -> minio

osparc-simcore ancillary service - minio S3 compatible storage server

Deployment is done via ansible.  See:

- osparc-simcore/ops/ansible/ancillary-minio.yml

This directory is where we put things necessary to _build_ the ancillary service for minio.  e.g. Dockerfiles.  Since nothing is needed at this time, directory is empty.
