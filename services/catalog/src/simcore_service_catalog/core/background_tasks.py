"""This background task does the following:
1. gets the full list of services from the docker registry through the director
2. gets the same list from the DB
3. if services are missing from the DB, they are added with basic access rights
3.a. basic access rights are set as following:
    1. writable access allow the user to change meta data as well as access rights
    2. executable access allow the user to see/execute the service
