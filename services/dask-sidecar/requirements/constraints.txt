# the dask-gateway local backend is currently using dask 2022.12.1
# distributed 2023.2.1 introduces breaking changes that break tests
# in director-v2. If this becomes an issue these tests will have to be refactored
# to use a real osparc-gateway that relies on the dask-sidecar instead
# of the integrated dask-scheduler built in the dask-gateway
