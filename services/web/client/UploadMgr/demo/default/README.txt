NOTE:: If you build this yourself, note that it will upload to http://www.zenesis.com (the uploads are deleted as soon
as they arrive).  If you want to test a local server, try the node.js version based on multer in server/multer - but 
remember that you will need to change the upload URL in the Application.js, or add "?uploadUrl=http://localhost:9090"
when running the application
