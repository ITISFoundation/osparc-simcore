    - deletion of users. If a user needs to be deleted it is manually marked as GUEST

    websocket identifiers for all opened tabs accross all broser for each user

    The alive/dead keys are normal Redis keys. To each key and ALIVE key is associated,
    which has an assigned TTL. The browser will call the `client_heartbeat` websocket
    endpoint to refresh the TTL, thus declaring that the user (websocket connection) is
    still active. The `resource_deletion_timeout_seconds` is theTTL of the key.
