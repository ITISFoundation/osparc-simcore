    Garbage collection has the task of removing trash (i.e. unused resources) from the system. The trash
    can be divided in:

    - Websockets & Redis (used to keep track of current active connections)
    - GUEST users (used for temporary access to the system which are created on the fly)
    - Deletion of users. If a user needs to be deleted it can be set as GUEST in the database

    The resources are Redis entries where all information regarding all the
    websocket identifiers for all opened tabs accross all browser for each user
    are stored.

    The alive/dead keys are normal Redis keys. To each key an ALIVE key is associated,
    which has an assigned TTL (Time To Live). The browser will call the `client_heartbeat` websocket
    endpoint to refresh the TTL, thus declaring that the user (websocket connection) is
    still active. The `resource_deletion_timeout_seconds` is the TTL of the key.

    The field `garbage_collection_interval_seconds` defines the interval at which this
    function will be called.
