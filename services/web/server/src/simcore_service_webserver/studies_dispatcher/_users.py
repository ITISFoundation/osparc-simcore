    #  1. During construction:
    #     - Prevents GC from deleting this GUEST user while it is being created
    #     - Since the user still does not have an ID assigned, the lock is named with his random_uname

    #   - In case of failure or excessive delay the lock has a timeout that automatically unlocks it
    #     and the GC can clean up what remains
    #   - Notice that the ids to name the locks are unique, therefore the lock can be acquired w/o errors
    #   - These locks are very specific to resources and have timeout so the risk of blocking from GC is small
