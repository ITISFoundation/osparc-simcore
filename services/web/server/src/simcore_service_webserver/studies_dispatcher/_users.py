    #
    #  1. During construction:
    #     - Prevents GC from deleting this GUEST user while it is being created
    #     - Since the user still does not have an ID assigned, the lock is named with his random_user_name
    #     - the timeout here is the TTL of the lock in Redis. in case the webserver is overwhelmed and cannot create
    #       a user during that time or crashes, then redis will ensure the lock disappears and let the garbage collector do its work
    #
    MAX_DELAY_TO_CREATE_USER = 5  # secs
    #
    #  2. During initialization
    #     - Prevents the GC from deleting this GUEST user, with ID assigned, while it gets initialized and acquires it's first resource
    #     - Uses the ID assigned to name the lock
    #
    MAX_DELAY_TO_GUEST_FIRST_CONNECTION = 15  # secs
    #
    #
    # NOTES:
    #   - In case of failure or excessive delay the lock has a timeout that automatically unlocks it
    #     and the GC can clean up what remains
    #   - Notice that the ids to name the locks are unique, therefore the lock can be acquired w/o errors
    #   - These locks are very specific to resources and have timeout so the risk of blocking from GC is small
