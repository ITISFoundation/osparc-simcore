- How to detect that a particular feature/characteristic in an entity has changed over time?

Feature/charateristics of an entity at a given moment can be "snapshot" and given a hash value
- If the same feature at another moment results in a different hash value, it means that this feature
has changed

    A working copy is a real project associated to a snapshot so it can be operated
    as a project resource (e.g. run, save, etc).

    The uuid of the workcopy is a composition of the repo-project uuid and the snapshot-checksum
    i.e. all identical snapshots (e.g. different iterations commits) map to the same project workcopy
    can avoid re-run

    If a snapshot is identical but associated to two different repos, then it will still be
    treated as a separate project to avoid colision between e.g. two users having coincidentaly the same
    worbench blueprint. Nonetheless, this could be refined in the future since we could use this
