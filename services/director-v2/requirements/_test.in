sqlalchemy[mypy] # adds Mypy / Pep-484 Support for ORM Mappings SEE https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/extensions/mypy.html

# NOTE: What test client to use for fastapi-based apps?
#
# fastapi comes with a default test client: fatapi.testclient.TestClient (SEE https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/)
# which is essentially an indirection to starlette.testclient (SEE https://www.starlette.io/testclient/)
#
# the limitation of that client is that it is fd synchronous.
#
# There are two options in place:
# a) fastapi recommends to use httpx and create your own AsyncTestClient: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/async-tests/
#   PROS: can use respx to mock responses, used to httpx API
#   CONS: do it yourself, does not include app member out-of-the-box
# b) use generic Async ASGI TestClient library:  https://github.com/vinissimus/async-asgi-testclient
#   PROS: generic closed solution, has 'app' member , requests-like API (i.e. equivalent to starletter TESTClient)
#   CONS: basically does not have the PROS from a), adds extra deps to 'requests' lib.
