# Shortcut to install all packages needed to develop 'services/director-v2'
#
# - As ci.txt but with current and repo packages in develop (edit) mode
#
# Usage:
#   pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
#

# installs base + tests requirements
-r _test.txt

# installs this repo's packages
-e ../../packages/models-library
-e ../../packages/postgres-database/[migration]
-e ../../packages/pytest-simcore/

# installs current package
-e .

# basic dev tools

## NOTE: Copied from ../../../requirements.txt to avoid mounting
#        basedir in docker during devel-mode.
#  TODO: Better solution needed!
