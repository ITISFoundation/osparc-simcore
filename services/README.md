# services

Each folder contains a service that is part of the platform's main stack. There is a separate repository https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-ops/ with extra stacks for operations (e.g. monitoring, logging, ...).


## Development Workflow

To build images for development

```bash
make build-devel
make up-devel
```

To build images for production

```bash
make build tag-version
make up-version
```

## Deploying Services

To build and tag these images:

```bash
make build tag-version tag-latest
```

To deploy the application in a single-node swarm

```bash
make up-latest
```

### Pattern Notes

1. **Standard pattern**: 17/20 Python services use `common_library.docker_healthcheck` (HTTP GET to health endpoint).
2. **Worker-mode**: Services with Celery workers (`api-server`, `notifications`, `storage`) use `HEALTHCHECK_MODE=heartbeat` env to switch to file-based heartbeat check.
3. **Exception flow**: `HealthCheckError` → 503 plain-text. Registered via `set_app_default_http_error_handlers` or explicitly.
4. **Intentional deviations**:
   - `dynamic-sidecar` (start_period=64s, JSON response) — container launch delays.
   - `notifications` (start_period=90s) — Celery broker connection warmup.
   - `migration` (start_period=60s, shell script) — one-shot job, not a long-running service.
   - `docker-api-proxy` (curl + basic auth) — Caddy proxy with no Python runtime for healthchecks.
