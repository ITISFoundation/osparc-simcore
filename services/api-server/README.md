## Development

Setup environment

```cmd
make devenv
source .venv/bin/activate
cd services/api-server
make install-dev
```

Then

```cmd
make run-devel
```

will start the api-server in development-mode together with a postgres db initialized with test data. Open the following sites and use the test credentials ``user=key, password=secret`` to manually test the API:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs: redoc documentation
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev/docs: swagger type of documentation

### Profiling requests to the api server
When in development mode (the environment variable `API_SERVER_DEV_FEATURES_ENABLED` is =1 in the running container) one can profile calls to the API server directly from the client side. On the server, the profiling is done using [Pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument). If we have our request in the form of a curl command, one simply adds the custom header `x-profile-api-server:true` to the command, in which case the profile is received under the `profile` key of the response body. This makes it easy to visualise the profiling report directly in bash:
```bash
<curl_command> -H 'x-profile-api-server: true' | jq -r .profile
```

## Clients

- Python client for osparc-simcore API can be found in https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore-client)


## Backwards compatibility of the server API
The public API is required to be backwards compatible in the sense that a [client](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore-clients) which is compatible with API version `N` should also be compatible with version `N+1`. Because of this, upgrading the server should never force a user to upgrade their client: The client which they have is already compatible with the new server.

```

In this diagram the development workflow/progress is indicated with ðŸ”¨-arrows both for the server client. To see which client version a given server version is compatible with one can follow the backwards ðŸ”™-arrows from that server version. E.g. one sees that the server in `staging` is compatible with the client in `staging` and in `production`. Needless to say, to see which versions of the server a given client is compatible with one can follow the dotted lines backwards from the client version. E.g. the client in `master` is seen to be compatible with ther server versions in `master` and in `dev branch`.
