"""
This is a light compatibilty test to check some expected features on fastapi

These tests aim to detect changes in some selected feature specs after upgrades of fastapi
or related libraries.

After some dependency upgrades some of the features tested belowed changed
specs which caused tests/public-api to fail. Changes were indeed detected but
`tests/public-api` are heavy system testing and made the debugging and discovery
of the problem very time consuming.

By adding these checks we intend to mitigate this problem by providing a fast
and early detection of changes in the specs of selected features
when fastapi or related libraries are upgraded.
