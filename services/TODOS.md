# TODOS

sylvain, we can use this file to keep track of remaining issues.

**PLEASE remove this file before final PR to upstream!**

- [ ] TODO: update README and in general all documentation
- [ ] TODO: rename folders under services using prefix to identify 3rd parties and dynamic
- [x] move web-client and web-server into the same folder
- [ ] TODO: label and tagging strategy (numbering, label-standard and automation scripts)


## Open Questions

- docker configurations?
  - development? there can be different situations, e.g. w/ or w/o qx-client, w/ or w/o tests, ...
  - production is directly what you get into build?
