        description: "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was approved in 1997 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [1] as an invasive neuromodulator approach for the treatment of epilepsy in anti-epileptic drug (AED) resistant subjects. As the vagus nerve (VN) innervates many organs, it is candidate for many new potentially therapeutically relevant applications of selective neurostimulation.",

        description: "Sim4Life, with its expanded simulative abilities of T-NEURO, permits the investigation of the mechanisms of interaction between EM fields and the electrical activity of neuronal membranes. A wide range of applications ranging from neurostimulation investigations (e.g. transcranial electric (TES) and magnetic (TMS) stimulation), safety (e.g. against peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), as well as the computationally assisted development of electroceuticals or neuroprostetic devices, is now possible. Anatomically realistic compartmentalized electrophysiological representations of axons and neurons modeled using NEURON [3] libraries according to Sim4Life pre-defined biophysical models or available in the web-depository databases â€“ can be positioned within the computational human head/body models to predict the physiological response of nerve and neurons to applied electric (E-) or magnetic (M-) fields.",

They can be created as well as random spline trajectories within specified entities (for example within fascicles) using the Sim4Life IMSafe tool for implant safety evaluations.",

These features can be also used for the visualization of customized post-pro quantities derived from python script (e.g., compound action potentials).",
