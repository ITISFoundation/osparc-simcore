# This config shall not be used alone but after docker-compose.yml
#
# NOTES:
# - Overrides docker-compose.yml config when deploying services locally
# - Should not introduce a substantial different with respect the configuration deployed
# - Added ports to enforce they are published in the swarm (e.g. for integration testing).
# - sidecar cannot publish port with ingress mode since it can't be used with dnsrr mode
# - Port bindings "300X:3000" reserved for remote debugging
#   - debug mode can be activated if SC_BOOT_MODE=debug-ptvsd (this is the default in devel).
#   - use vscode debugger "Python: Remote Attach *" config in  ''.vscode-template/launch.json'
