# Minimal docker-compose configuration to deploy a stack that contains a selection
# of the services deployed with ITISFoundation/osparc-ops
#
# These configurations avoid having to deploy the entire
# ITISFoundation/osparc-ops to operate osparc-simcore stack during development
#
# By default, the **ops** stack is automatically deployed in all the make up-* targets but
# can be disabled passing the 'ops_disabled' flag
#
# $ make ops_disabled=1 up-devel
# $ make ops_disabled=1 up-prod
# $ make ops_disabled=1 up-vesioned
# $ make ops_disabled=1 up-latest
#
# Nonetheless, notice that minio is a service used from simcore stack. Therefore, disabling ops stack
# is meaningful ONLY when simcore stack is intended to run with the the actual stacks from osparc-ops
#
#  NOTE: this stack cannot be called tools because it collides with default network created in services/static-webserver/client/tools/docker-compose.yml
#  IMPORTANT: This stack IS NOT used in the deployed version
