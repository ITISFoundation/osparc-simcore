# invitations

``invitations`` is a service to create and validate invitations. It offers two interfaces for these operations: a CLI and a http-API .

This service will be used as part of the osparc-simcore stack to validate and extract incoming invitation codes. It can
also be used standalone to generate invitations. These two services instances will produce and consume invitations as soon as
they use the same ``INVITATIONS_SECRET_KEY``


## Usage
These are some usage example using directly the executable or the docker image:

### With executable ``simcore-service-invitations``

We assume the executable ``simcore-service-invitations`` is installed. You can test by typing
```cmd
simcore-service-invitations --version
```
If not, use ``make install-prod``. Once installed have a look at all the possibilites
```cmd
simcore-service-invitations --help
```

#### Setup

Create ``.env`` file
```
simcore-service-invitations generate-dotenv --auto-password > .env
set -o allexport; source .env; set +o allexport
```
and modify the ``.env`` if needed


#### Creating invitations via CLI

Create an invitation for ``guest@company.com`` as
```
simcore-service-invitations invite guest@company.com --issuer=me
```
and will produce a link

#### Validating invitations via CLI

```
simcore-service-invitations check http://my-invitation-link
```

#### Starting HTTP API

Start it as a web app as
```
simcore-service-invitations serve
```
and then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev/doc


### With docker image ``itisfoundation/invitations:latest``

Here we assume the image ``itisfoundation/invitations:latest`` is published in dockerhub. It can be tested by
```cmd
docker run -it itisfoundation/invitations:latest simcore-service-invitations --version
```
Otherwise, you can build the image tagged as ``local/invitations:production`` using ``make build``. Then check help
```cmd
docker run -it itisfoundation/invitations:latest simcore-service-invitations --help
```
#### Setup

Create ``.env`` file
```
docker run -it itisfoundation/invitations:latest simcore-service-invitations generate-dotenv --auto-password > .env
```
and modify the ``.env`` if needed



#### Creating invitations via CLI

Create an invitation for ``guest@company.com`` as
```
docker run -it --env-file .env  itisfoundation/invitations:latest simcore-service-invitations invite guest@company.com --issuer=me
```
and will produce a link



#### Starting  HTTP API

Start it as a web app as
```
docker run -it --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 itisfoundation/invitations:latest simcore-service-invitations serve
```
and then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev/doc.

To create an invitation just
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/invitations' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "issuer": "issuerid",
  "guest": "invitedguest@company.com",
  "trial_account_days": 2
}'
```
