## Postgres configuration

Read and follow instructons in `./scripts/init.sql` script. This needs to be executed once in every postgres database we run (both self-hosted and RDS)

Create role and users scripts need to be run on demand (e.g. in case we need a readonly user). Generate scripts using repo config values, read and follow instructions inside. This needs to be executed once.
