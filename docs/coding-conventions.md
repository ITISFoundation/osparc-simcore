# Coding Conventions and Linters

Coding styles and linters are provided for the Javascript and Python.

## Javascript

In general the `qooxdoo` naming convention/style is followed. The [Access](http://qooxdoo.org/docs/#/core/oo_feature_summary?id=access) paragraph is the most notable. It is recommended to read the entire document.

Have a look at `ESLint`'s configuration files [.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json) and [.eslintignore](.eslintignore).

## Python

`Black` will enforce the style. Just use it.

Have a look at `Pylint`'s configuration file [.pylintrc](.pylintrc).
