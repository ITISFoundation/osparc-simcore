# Contributing guidelines

We adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct) found below.

### Want to add a new feature?

- avoid pushing new features directly (also [consider no upstream pushing](docs/no-upstream-push.md))
- [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to your private github
- create a new branch with a name meaningful for the feature at hand
- [create a Draft Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with `WIP:` in its name to the `master` branch (example: `WIP: documentation updates`)
- commit all your work to your new branch; other developers can provided feedback by reviewing your pull request
- when the feature is ready: remove the `WIP:` and set it ready to review
- when your changes get approved, remember to always select **Squash and merge** from the drop-down button

New features are merged when CI is passing and two other members approve your pull request.

### CI notes

For GitHub Actions, the CI needs to pull and push docker images to a repository. Using
[docker hub](https://hub.docker.com) is advised.
New registries will be created and images will be pushed and pulled during builds. Have a look
at [docker-compose-build.yml](services/docker-compose-build.yml) for a full list of names.
To avoid collisions make sure the names of the services are not used by your other projects.


To enable GitHub Actions on your forked repository:

- go to the `Actions` page and enable them
- go to the repo's `Settings` page and the click on `Secrets`
- you have to add the following:
    - `DOCKER_USERNAME` docker hub username
    - `DOCKER_REGISTRY` docker hub username
    - `DOCKER_PASSWORD` docker hub access token **(avoid using your password)**

### Code styles and conventions

Current setup: [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for `JavaScript` and [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) + [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) for `Python`. Have a look in the project root for individual configuration files.

Read more at [Coding Conventions and Linters](docs/coding-conventions.md).

### FAQ

**Q:** I have strange database errors, but I did not change anything. What could I try?
**A:** After starting the application, apply Postgres migrations, run `make help` in project root for details.

**Q:** I am new to the project, how do I view all available commands?
**A:** Run `make help` in the directory containing a `Makefile`. Usage will be shown. Don't be afraid to read the file, it is quite strait forward and well documented.

**Q:** My pull request's CI is failing to push/pull images from Docker Hub?
**A:** Check your settings again, [see CI-notes](#ci-notes) and retry.

**Q:** It is not clear how dependencies work. Where can I read more?
**A:** [Management of python dependencies](docs/python-dependencies.md) has a detailed explanation and useful resources.

**Q:** I see and `api` folder full of text files, what is it?
**A:** Look at [APIs development guidelines](api/README.md) it will point you in the right direction.

**Q:** Do you need to commit something (maybe work in progress) and it makes no sense to have the CI run it?
**A:** Add `[ci skip]` in any part of your commit message. The CI will not run get started.

**Q:** I don't have a good understanding of the aims of the project. Where can I read more?
**A:** [D1.1 Technical Specs. & Technology Evaluation](https://osparc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is extensive, but explains the decision making behind most of the code. Please consider reading it. Afterwords you can better grasp the [Computational backend](docs/comp-services.md) description.

**Q:** Can I have some sort of introduction video about the project?
**A:** Have a look at the following videos, targeted for wider audiences: [What is the SPARC program?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrZS_IHgrcE&feature=emb_title), [Ideas Lab Introduction to o²S²PARC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&v=Q96jyFgSFHc&feature=emb_title) and [SPARC Webinar: Introduction to o²S²PARC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrdVealYydE&feature=emb_title)

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[code-of-conduct@osparc.io](mailto:code-of-conduct@osparc.io).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
