# [vscode] configuration folder

Recommended workspace settings for [vscode]. **PLEASE** keep this file clean and entries sorted alphabetically (at least first entry).

Duplicate and rename this folder as ``.vscode``.


## Workarounds

 - [vscode] interactive testing does not work if pytest config fails. Moving ``pytest.ini`` in the root and add setting searching paths for testing folders solves the problem
