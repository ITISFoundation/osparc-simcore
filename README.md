## Overview

![service-web](docs/img/service-interaction.svg)


A graph view of services, ports, volumes and service dependencies:
![](docs/img/docker-compose-wo-networks.png)

## Usage

```bash
  # clone repo
  git clone https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore.git
  cd osparc-simcore

  # show setup info and build core services
  make info build

  # starts swarm and deploys services
  make up-prod

  # display swarm configuration
  make info-swarm

  # open browser in:
  #  localhost:9081 - simcore front-end site
  #
  xdg-open http://localhost:9081/

  # stops
  make down
```

## Requirements

To build and run:

- docker
- make >=4.2
- awk, jq (optional tools within makefiles)

To develop, in addition:

- python 3.6 (this dependency will be deprecated soon)
- [vscode] (highly recommended)


### Developing in **Windows**

In windows, it works under [WSL] (windows subsystem for linux).
It is also highly recommended using [chocolatey] as packages manager.

- [Install](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation) chocolatey
  - ``choco install docker-for-windows``
  - ``choco install wsl`` or using [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
-  Follow **all details** on [how to setup flawlessly](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly) docker for windows and [WSL]


## Releases

- [Git release workflow](ops/README.md)
- Public [releases](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/releases)
- Production in https://osparc.io
