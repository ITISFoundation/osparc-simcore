coverage         # Measures code coverage during test execution
pytest           # Framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries
pytest-cov       # Produces coverage reports
pytest-icdiff    # Better diffs in pytest assertion error messages using ICDiff
pytest-instafail # Shows failures and errors instantly instead of waiting until the end of test session
pytest-sugar     # Shows failures and errors instantly, adding a progress bar, improving the test results, and making the output look better
