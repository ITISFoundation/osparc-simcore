## Package version dispersion

The same package listed in different requirements should have as similar version as possible througout the repository.

Different versions of the same package is denoted here as *dispersion*.

Dispersion can be monitored in the tables created after ugprades using ``requirements/tools/check_changes.py`` or simply
``cmd
make devenv
source .venv/bin/activate
cd requirements/tools
make report
code report.ignore.md
```

## Example

For instance, in this table (a part taken from ``upgrade-report.ignore.md``) we see that some packages have multiple versions across requirements.

| #   | name              | versions-base                   | versions-test                   | versions-tool              |

in order to unify the versions, we can upgrade each of them individually in batch as follows

```bash

packages=orjson,packaging,prometheus-client,psycopg2-binary,pyparsing,pyrsistent,python-dotenv,requests # ... and many more

for u in ${packages//,/ }
do
   make reqs-all upgrade=$u &> reqs-$u.log
   git commit -am "upgrades $u" --no-verify
done
```

It would also be possible to upgrade them simultaneously by using ``--upgrade`` multiple times as ``uv pip compile --upgrade X --upgrade Y ...``
but we prefer to do it one by one and commit changes so that any issue can be tracked to the library upgrade


TIP: Check the **Repo-wide overview of libraries** table in the report. Observe the libraries with multiple version in ``version-*`` columns. Note that we can use the script to unifyunify:
  - Those with no ``version-base`` and multiple in ``version-test``
  - Thos with multiple in ``version-base`` and non in ``version-test``
