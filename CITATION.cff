  o²S²PARC (Open Online Simulations for Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions)
  is a simulation platform responsible for the SIM-Core within [NIH SPARC program](https://sparc.science/).
  This platform enables users to create, access, tune, and run models or
  computational algorithms through web based interface. Web interactive simulation platform that
  hosts SPARC computational models and solvers. Allows collaborative development and sharing, model
  coupling and cloud based execution, data visualization and analysis, and ensures sustainability of
  computational models developed within the [SPARC portal](https://sparc.science/).
  Enables users to create predictive, multiscale, multi-physics
  models spanning from modulation sources acting on peripheral nervous system (PNS) to
  resulting modulation of organ functional response.
  This project is funded by NIH SPARC Award #OT3OD025348.
