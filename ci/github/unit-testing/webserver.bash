# isolated = these tests are (IMO) real unit tests, they do not need any dependencies and were already in the root test/unit folder before

# db medium = are tests that take 3-5 minutes, altogether about 10 minutes (db stand for database-dependency, these tests were already in test/unit/with_dbs folder)
# db fast = all the others (db stand for database-dependency, these tests were already in test/unit/with_dbs folder)
