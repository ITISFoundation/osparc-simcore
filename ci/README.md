# Continuous Integration

## CI / Dockerhub setup

The osparc-simcore repository provides a Travis-CI [recipe](.travis.yml) and Gihub-CI [workflows](.github/workflows) that fullfills the [Release Workflow](docs/img/git-release-workflow.svg) and the [Hotfix Workflow](docs/img/git-hotfix-workflow.svg).

### Configuration
Github Actions and/or Travis-CI should be enabled for the repository in each fork and a [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) account is recommended to push the docker images generated by the CI.

Configuring your CI settings will speed up the CI process by making use of Dockerhub (or another docker registry) to move docker images between stages.

### Secrets configuration

Define the following secure environment variables in your fork:

```bash
DOCKER_REGISTRY # this shall be set to your own dockerhub repository account for example: itisfoundation
DOCKER_USERNAME # the docker username
DOCKER_PASSWORD # the docker password
```
